Directadmin Capri Skin

This is a repo for the Directadmin skin so we can update it to newer version and make it even better.

We do not include the functions.php here becouse it have the licence check in it!
But we do a version check and update true github

INFO:
To use the in-skin update function u need to chmod all files and folders under /usr/local/directadmin/data/skin/capri to 777 OR set the owner to admin:admin
After a directadmin the rights will be reset!

: Update 10-03-2015

Functions.php is now included without licence check. 
This improves the overal speed of the skin allot. Also is now posible to use this skin in all directadmin servers u have for FREE!
